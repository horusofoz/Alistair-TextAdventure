  storyText: "Feeling a fool for losing the surprise, you catch a bow from your Sarah's
    father who draws a sword and joins the men in the front.\r\n\r\nDrawing an arrow
    you begin firing. Feeling the pain and rage of the nights' events, you put everything
    you have into it. \n\nDraw, loose, draw loose. You run out of arrows and begin
    taking them from the other bowmen. You don't even count the number slain as calm
    takes you and the cycle of draw and loose becomes your world..."
