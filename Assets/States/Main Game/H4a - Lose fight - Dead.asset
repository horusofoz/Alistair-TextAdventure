  storyText: 'Remembering the faces of your parents and with Karla''s screams in your
    ears, you let go a fierce battle cry and charge.


    You are amongst the raiders in a split second swing with all the ferocity of a
    cornered tiger.


    But courage and anger is not enough. It''s one unskilled young man with a blade
    against a number of armed and shielded veterans.


    You fight to the last but then the last comes.


    So ends the legend of Alistair.'
