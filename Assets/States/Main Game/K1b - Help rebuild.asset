  storyText: "Tears fall from your eyes but you refuse to cry. \n\nFeeling betrayed
    by these men but knowing they are right, you  turn and begin walking back to your
    home. Your parents bodies deserve a decent burial.\n\nYou remember your father's
    sword in the chest under his bed. You will claim it and train every day until
    you are ready to go after the raiders and save your sister.\n\nYou will also train
    the stronger children so you know they'll be ready if raiders come again.\n\r\nThus
    begins the tale of Alistair."
