  storyText: 'You rush to Sararh''s house and knock hard on the door calling out for
    Sarah.


    Sarah''s father answers the door scowling until he sees the look on your face.


    Without a word he pushes past you and steps out the house.


    Taking in the sounds and smells, you see he understands the situation. He turns
    to you with a look fiercer than you''ve seen there before.


    "Thank you for the warning Alistair. Go see to your house. I''ll see to Sarah
    and my wife"'
