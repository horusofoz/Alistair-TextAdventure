  storyText: 'You and the the raider are running at each other at full tilt when he
    begins to swing his sword back for an overhand strike.


    He underestimated your brazen anger as you launch yourself at him below the swing
    and slide your small blade back and forth into his torse and neck.


    By the time you both hit the ground, your hands and clothes are drenched in blood.
    You see he is dead or near enough to no longer be a threat.


    You look up and see more scum are running towards you now. They''ve got shields
    ready and are coming at you in a coordinated rush.'
  actionText: '1) Pickup the fallen raider''s sword and charge

    2) The cooling blood on your hands has snapped you from your rage state. There
    is too many top fight at once. You turn and sprint towards the forest.'
