  storyText: 'Running at a sprint with dark thoughts in your head, you don''t even
    see Bardoc the blacksmith before you run straight into him. The man''s bulk knocks
    you on your ass.


    "Alistair? Is that you? Aww boy, I''m sorry son."


    He bends over and starts picking you uup on your feet like your were a the size
    of a small child.


    "There''s no easy way nor the time to say this. The raiders slew your parents.
    They tried to take your mother. Your father went beserk. Bbut sharp steel did
    him. Your mother then pulled out one of their eyes so they did the same to her
    and moved on."


    "Alistair, I know your a strong lad but I need you to head to forest on the east
    side of the village. I''ve sent every youth too small to fight that way. They''ll
    need a smart lad like you to keep them calm and send them in the right direciton
    if these raiders over take use. Can you do that?'
