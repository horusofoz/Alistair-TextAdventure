  storyText: "Knowing it's worse job of every day, you decide to head straight to
    cleaning the chicken coops and cattle stalls. Dirty, smelly work. But if you get
    in and get it done quick, you can take a dip before the main work day starts.
    Then you'll only stink of sweat. Better that than chicken poop.\r\n\r\nDad sees
    you coming from the stalls when he wakes up. It warms your heart to see one of
    his rare smiles. He knows your working hard."
  actionText: 1) Get the work done quicker, the sooner you can have some fun.
