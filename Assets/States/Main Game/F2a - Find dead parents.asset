  storyText: 'You round the corner and come to the high burning flames that have engulfed
    your home.


    No... No.


    You see 2 corpses layed out in front of your house. You don''t need to get closer
    to know but you have to see.


    You fall to your knees before them. Both are gone. It appears to have been quick.
    Just as despair threatens to overtake you a word appears in your head...


    KARLA


    You know the raiders couldn''t have come from the direction you came from so you
    begin running in the opposite direction calling out your sister''s name.'
  actionText: 1) Search for your sister.
