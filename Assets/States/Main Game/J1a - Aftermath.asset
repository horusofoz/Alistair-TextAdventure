  storyText: "At the town centre the survivors are debating what to do\r. You argue
    passionately for chasing the raiders. You want to save your sister. Don't they
    want to save their loved ones who were taken\r?\n\nBardoc argues to stay. \"That
    force was too disciplined to to not be professionals. If we chase them, we leave
    the town undefended from a flanking force. If they are half as smart as they looked,
    that'd be there first move.\".\n\nYou're not convinced and begin to call the townspeople
    cowards. \nSarah begs you to stay. \n\nYou're torn. Karla is in chains with those
    scum. There is a whole town needing every hand to rebuild. A dozen children or
    more have become orphaned and will need homes to take them in. The wounded will
    need caring for. But Karla..."
  actionText: '1) You cannot wait another moment. You head off for Karla.

    2) You will never forgive yourself but you know the town and children need you.
    You stay to help rebuild.'
