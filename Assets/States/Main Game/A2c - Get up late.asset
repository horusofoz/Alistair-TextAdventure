  storyText: "You rush from your bed and am hopping trying to pull on a boot as you
    come out the front door. Dazed by the sun you you don't see the half hearted swing
    but feel the cuff across the back of the head. \r\n\r\n\"Boy! You're my only son
    meaning this farm is going to be yours one day. Unless you plan to sell it when
    I'm gone, put your mum and sister on the street and live on the tavern porch for
    the rest of your life, you best learn to get up with the sun. Come on now. We
    got a whole day's work ahead of us and now we gotta chase that hour of sweat you
    just lost. Get to them chicken and have at it.\"\r"
