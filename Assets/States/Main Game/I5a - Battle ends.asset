  storyText: "A loud bugle breaks you from your trance. \n\nAt first you don't know
    what it means but then you see the remaining raiders begin a fighting withdrawal.
    Your arrows continue their devastation but the raiders with shields raised are
    able to escape.\n\r\nYou go to run after them but Bardoc grabs you and puills
    you into a bear hug. He knows what you've seen and done tonight. He tells you
    he's been there too. He know you want to fight till you fall. But he can't let
    it happen. The town needs you. Sarah will need you. The children you saved will
    need you. \n\nAfter a minute you stop thrashing and accept it. bardoc and Sarah's
    father keep talking to you in soft tones as the group of defenders head to the
    town centre."
